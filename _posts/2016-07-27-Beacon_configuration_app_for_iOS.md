### **Hello AppStore, again**

Today we released a new [BeaCfg app on the AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/sb/app/beacfg/id1107926908?mt=8)

Version 1.4 brings a few minor improvements to detection and editing beacon values, and a new sorting functionality which allows ordering the detected beacons either by proximity (Received Signal Strength) or by the order in which your iOS device discovered them.  
To configure a beacon:  
- remove the battery (in the case of USB beacons simply disconnect them)  
- open the app  
- re-insert the battery (connect USB beacon)  
- tap on the beacon and start the configuration process    

To get a better idea, here's a short video of how it works:
