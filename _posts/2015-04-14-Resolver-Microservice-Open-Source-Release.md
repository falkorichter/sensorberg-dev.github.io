We have decided to Open Source the Resolver microservice. You can use this microservice to set up your own location based service. For now, the service syncs with our cloud platform at [manage.sensorberg.com](https://manage.sensorberg.com) and enables your apps to resolve beacons even when they are offline.

This is a prerelease of the Resolver as some features are still missing for a full rollout. We will keep you up to date about any changes in this blog.

WeÂ´re hosting a resolver which is in sync with all applications as well, if you do not feel the need to host your own Resolver Microservice.
