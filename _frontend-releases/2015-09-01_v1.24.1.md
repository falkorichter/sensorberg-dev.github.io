There is a new update to the Beacon Manager Application (v1.24.1).
You can now view the statistics of your campaigns and beacons over any time period in the past. You can also toggle easily between seeing the statistics for all of your campaigns or any subset of them using a select all switch.

If you are looking for a range of less than a day, or enter in particular hours besides midnight to midnight in your date, then your statistics chart will be broken down hourly rather than by day.

There were a few small bugs along the way that were cleaned up, but hopefully the interface will be giving you a clearer overview of the activities the system has recorded for your beacon campaigns.

* From and To: Specific dates for Statistics Chart
* Hourly message breakdowns for one day or hour specific date ranges
* Shows all campaigns/beacons/apps in the default view rather than paginated.
