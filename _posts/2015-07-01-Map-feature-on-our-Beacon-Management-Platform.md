# Get a quick overview of the location of your Beacons<br/>

You can now enter the location of any of your Beacons on our Beacon Management Platform. While adding or editing a Beacon, you can do that by:

* Directly entering the latitude and longitude coordinates of your Beacon (up to 14 decimals after the comma, way more than what is needed for a millimeter precision...)


* Searching a location using the textfield; you can also move and zoom the map to manually find the location. You'll be able to add it by a click on the map

We'll also release soon a tool to design building plans in order for you to visualize properly and optimize the location of your Beacons within your facilities...
