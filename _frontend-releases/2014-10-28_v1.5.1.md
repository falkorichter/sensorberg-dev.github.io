# New beacon selector in campaign edit view

After typing in some characters you will be presented a filtered list of beacons
Selecting one can be done with mouse or using the arrow keys and pressing enter
Removing beacons can be done with mouse (x) or keyboard (backspace) as well

Lots of changes under the hood to increase code quality
