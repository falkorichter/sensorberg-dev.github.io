# Everything you need to get started with our Cloud Platform in a nutschell<br/>

Our marketing team has designed three quick tutorials to help you get onboard with our Beacons and Content Management Platform. You'll find everything to get started: registering your Beacons, linking your app - or the Sensorberg Showcase app - to your account, and designing a campaign. Those tutorials will also be on our Platform very soon.
