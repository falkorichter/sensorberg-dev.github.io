# Bugfixes

* hidden unique users in statistics - BM-1155
* updated graph dimensions - BM-1155

As a workaround to a more complicated issue with statistics we have hidden the unique users metric for now. Also the diagram dimensions were updated and when choosing "last day" you get a more detailed time bucket resolution. A more complete fix to the statistics module requires more work on the backend side and will be done later.
