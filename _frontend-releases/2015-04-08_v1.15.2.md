We did a bigger update last Thursday and a minor one today. Here is a list of changes:

## Pagination

list views of beacons, apps, campaigns and shares are now paginated
statistics list views are not paginated on purpose, these will be redone in the near future

## Windows OS hidden

when creating an app you can for now no longer select Windows as an OS
the backend still allows this, but the Frontend does not expose this functionality until the big Windows project is published
