Documentation for the Sensorberg SDKs.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sensorberg-dev/sensorberg-dev.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sensorberg-dev/sensorberg-dev.github.io)

If you want to see your drafts:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```
The drafts will not be visible on the actual website.

NEVER EDIT IN ```_site```as the directory is generated and all changes are always overwritten.

To install ```jekyll``` run:

```
bundle install
```

if you want to check all the links locally (including links in your drafts), run: ```bundle exec rake```
