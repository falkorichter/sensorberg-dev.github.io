Just a short notice.

Today's release of the management platform (v1.1.4) fixes the scheduling bug.

v1.1.5 - Do not check end date for unscheduled campaigns

Yesterday's release of the API (build #369) makes sure only the master account can see UUID, minor and major of public beacons.

Sincerely, the IT crowd.
