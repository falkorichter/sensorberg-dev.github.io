#Setting Custom API Keys, Resolver URLs, and Proximity UUIDs for Campaign Simulation on the iOS Showcase App

The iOS Showcase app has the following 3 features.

### Simulating beacons with custom proximity UUIDs
  
In the Showcase app we have the 'Beacon Simulation' functionality. Previously it was only possible to simulate beacons with the predefined proximity UUIDs in the app.  With our latest release it is now posible to add a custom proximity UUID and simulate any beacon associated with it.
  
**Add custom proximity UUIDs in 'Advanced option' of your application**
  
1. Select your application.
2. Select the Advanced option.
3. Enter a custom proximity UUID and associate a name to it.
4. Save the iOS Settings.
5. Save Application.
  
Ex : custom UUIDs
  
```javascript
{
  "customProximityUUIDs": {
    "124C5678-4444-1111-2222-134556728422": "SB-GUNNIH"
  }
}
```

*To use the new proximity UUID, scan the API Key for this app on your phone. Click on the ID field in the beacon simulator view, the new proximity UUID's name should appear in the list of available IDs.*
