# Bugfixes
* Campaigns without time windows no longer throw an error - BM-767
* Icons and labels in user menu have a proper margin now - BM-1146
* Campaigns without actions no longer throw an error - BM-1145
* Refactored authentication service - BM-1098

The last change is the main reason for this release, it improves security a bit and eliminates the very annoying "missing left-side menu" bug in the frontend that happened especially often when switching user accounts.
